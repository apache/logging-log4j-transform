= Log4j Transform

{project-name} contains tools for binary postprocessing of projects that use https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j2 API].

[#maven-bom]
== Maven Bill of Materials (BOM)

To keep your {project-name} module versions aligned, a https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#bill-of-materials-bom-poms[Maven Bill of Materials (BOM) POM] is provided for your convenience.

To use this with Maven, add the dependency listed below to your `pom.xml` file.
Note that the `<dependencyManagement>` nesting and the `<scope>import</scope>` instruction.
This will _import_ all modules bundled with the associated Log4j release to your `dependencyManagement`.
As a result, you don't have to specify versions of the imported modules (`log4j-weaver`, etc.) while using them as a `<dependency>`.
